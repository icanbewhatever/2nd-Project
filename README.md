Project: Clothes Production Management System (SCM)

Duration: January 30, 2024 – February 14, 2024
Team Size: 5 members
Tools Used: STS Eclipse, SQL Developer, DBeaver, Library, StarUML, Git
Project Description:
As part of a team project during the boot camp, we developed a Clothes Production Management System aimed at efficiently managing and tracking the production processes within the clothing industry. This project was executed over a span of two weeks with a team of five members. The main goal was to create a robust system using Java and Oracle Database for backend data management, while providing a user-friendly web interface using JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

Key aspects of the project included:

Backend Development: Utilized Java (JDBC) and Oracle Database to ensure reliable and efficient data management.
Frontend Development: Implemented a responsive and intuitive web interface using JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
Collaboration and Tools: The project was managed and developed using STS Eclipse for coding, SQL Developer and DBeaver for database management, StarUML for designing, and Git for version control.
This project provided valuable experience in full-stack development, enhancing my skills in both backend and frontend technologies, and fostering teamwork and collaboration in a real-world scenario.
